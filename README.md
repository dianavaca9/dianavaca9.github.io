# Computer Applications
## This Project represents a high level step into a project manager. Learning to use Markdown, CSS, and critical thinking. I am describing my goals for this year, while learning to clone, push and commit my repository. I am turning this page into a public and live url, while documenting my process using what i have learned so far this year.
