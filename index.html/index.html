    <h2>Computer Applications</h2>
<p>
    My goals for this class are to learn how to create a webiste and learn the core and basics
    of using HTML and Markdown.
    Using apps like Github, Github Desktop, Obisdian and Visual Code, should help me acheive 
    my goals for a career in technology. This is the first step in my school journey
    to achive this goal.
</p>
<p>
    I am currently halfway done through my bachelors degree in Computer applications
    at Texas Tech Univeristy.
    I am hoping to be able to land either a tech data scientist job for Nasa
    or a software engineer for them as well. 
    I am excited to continue this journey and see where it takes me in the tech world!
